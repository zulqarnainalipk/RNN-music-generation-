# ðŸŽµ RNN Music Generator

## Project Overview

Welcome to the fascinating world of music generation using advanced machine learning techniques! In this project, I've crafted a sophisticated recurrent neural network (RNN) model capable of generating musical notes. Leveraging a rich dataset consisting of enchanting piano MIDI files sourced from the prestigious MAESTRO dataset, this model is trained to predict the subsequent note in a sequence, empowering it to compose beautiful melodies autonomously. Moreover, it can extend its creations by conjuring longer sequences of notes, mesmerizing listeners with its harmonic prowess.
