# 🎶 **RNN Music Generation with TensorFlow and Keras** 

### 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Architectural Decision Document for RNN Music Generation! 🎼 In this document, we'll dive into the architectural choices behind implementing RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) music generation using TensorFlow and Keras.

### 2. Problem Statement
Let's harmonize our understanding: we aim to compose musical masterpieces using RNNs, capturing the essence of sequential musical data to generate fresh tunes! 🎶

### 3. Architectural Overview
Let's groove through the architecture:
#### 3.1 Data Preparation
Prepare your musical dataset for the jam session! 🎵
#### 3.2 Model Architecture
🎹 **Input Layer:** Where the melody begins.  
🎶 **LSTM Layer:** Capturing musical nuances and rhythms.  
🎼 **Output Layer:** Predicting the next musical note.  
#### 3.3 Training Process
Let the training symphony commence!
#### 3.4 Music Generation
Compose a new melody with the trained model. Let the music flow! 🌟

### 4. Key Architectural Decisions
Let's dissect the core decisions:
#### 4.1 Choice of RNN Model
LSTM: The maestro behind capturing musical intricacies. 🎻
#### 4.2 Data Representation
Musical data encoded for the neural orchestra to interpret. 🎸
#### 4.3 Loss Function Selection
Guiding the training with the right musical notes. 📉
#### 4.4 Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tuning for the perfect harmony. 🎵

### 5. Benefits and Future Enhancements
Hear the melody of benefits and future tunes:
#### Benefits:
- 🚀 **Seamless Integration:** TensorFlow and Keras - the dynamic duo for musical innovation!
